  <h1>Kernel Teachings of the Buddha</h1>

  <h2>The Four Noble Truths</h2>
  <p>The Buddha began his teaching with the Four Noble Truths, which form the foundation of the path:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span class="bold">The Truth of Unsatisfactoriness (Dukkha):</span> All conditioned existence is marked by unsatisfactoriness. Birth, aging, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are unsatisfactory. Even pleasure is unsatisfactory because it is impermanent and unreliable.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">The Truth of the Origin of Unsatisfactoriness:</span> Craving (<span class="italic">taṇhā</span>) is the cause. Craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence drive the cycle of rebirth and perpetuate unsatisfactoriness.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">The Truth of the Cessation of Unsatisfactoriness:</span> When craving is abandoned, unsatisfactoriness ceases. This cessation is Nibbāna, the unconditioned state beyond birth and death.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">The Truth of the Path:</span> The Noble Eightfold Path leads to cessation. It consists of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>The Five Aggregates</h2>
  <p>The Buddha analyzed the human being into five aggregates (<span class="italic">khandhas</span>), which together constitute what we call “a person”:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span class="bold">Form (Rūpa):</span> The physical body and material phenomena.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Feeling (Vedanā):</span> Pleasant, painful, or neutral sensations.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Perception (Saññā):</span> Recognition and labeling of experiences.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Fabrications (Saṅkhārā):</span> Volitional activities, mental formations, intentions.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Consciousness (Viññāṇa):</span> Awareness of sensory and mental objects.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Buddha taught that none of these aggregates are self. They are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not to be regarded as “I” or “mine.” In <span class="italic">SN 22.59 (Anattā-lakkhaṇa Sutta)</span>, he instructed disciples to see each aggregate as: “This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.”</p>

  <h3>Consciousness and Name-Form Loop</h3>
  <div class="images-container">
    <img src="images/image1.png" alt="Consciousness and Name-Form diagram 1">
    <img src="images/image2.png" alt="Consciousness and Name-Form diagram 2">
  </div>
  <p>In dependent origination (<span class="italic">SN 12.2</span>), consciousness and name-form (<span class="italic">nāma-rūpa</span>) condition each other. Consciousness requires name-form to manifest, and name-form requires consciousness to function. This mutual dependence shows that there is no independent self, only conditioned processes arising and ceasing. The Buddha emphasized that seeing this loop clearly dismantles the illusion of a permanent “I.”</p>

  <h2>Anattā (Not-Self)</h2>
  <p>The Buddha’s radical insight was that there is no permanent, unchanging self. The aggregates are conditioned, impermanent, and unsatisfactory. Clinging to them as “I” or “mine” creates the illusion of self and perpetuates unsatisfactoriness. Seeing clearly that all phenomena are not-self leads to disenchantment (<span class="italic">nibbidā</span>), dispassion (<span class="italic">virāga</span>), and liberation (<span class="italic">nibbāna</span>).</p>

  <h2>The Four Jhānas</h2>
  <p>The Buddha taught the practice of concentration leading to four stages of meditative absorption (<span class="italic">jhāna</span>). These are not ends in themselves but powerful supports for insight:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span class="bold">First Jhāna:</span> Seclusion from sensuality and unwholesome states. Characterized by applied and sustained thought, rapture, and pleasure born of seclusion.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Second Jhāna:</span> With the calming of applied and sustained thought, rapture and pleasure remain, accompanied by inner stillness and unification of mind.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Third Jhāna:</span> Rapture fades, leaving equanimity and mindfulness, with pleasure still present.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Fourth Jhāna:</span> Pure equanimity and mindfulness, with neither pleasure nor pain.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Importance for Insight</h3>
  <p>Jhāna stabilizes the mind, making it clear and concentrated. This stability allows insight into impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self. While insight can arise without deep absorption, the jhānas provide a powerful foundation for penetrating the nature of reality and achieving liberation. The Buddha consistently emphasized that concentration and insight work together: concentration steadies the mind, insight liberates it.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The kernel teachings of the Buddha emphasize:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Four Noble Truths as the framework of practice.</li>
    <li>The Five Aggregates as the analysis of experience, showing impermanence and not-self.</li>
    <li>The principle of <span class="italic">anattā</span>, dismantling the illusion of a permanent self.</li>
    <li>The Four Jhānas as the meditative foundation for insight.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Together, these teachings form a coherent path: understanding unsatisfactoriness, seeing through the aggregates, realizing not-self, and cultivating concentration and insight to reach Nibbāna.</p>
